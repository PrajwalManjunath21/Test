## Push a commit you have made

The first exercise is to push a commit that is created when you run the `git start` command.

Just try `git verify` after you have initialized the exercises and be proud of passing the first one :-)

=======
## Commit one file of two currently staged
There are two files created in the root project directory - `A.txt` and `B.txt`. They are both added to the staging 
area.

The goal is to commit only one of them.
